# Galaxy Collision Simulation
This is a numerical simulation of two colliding galaxies. 
I put a lot of effort into optimizing the program using Numpy and Numba. 
I applied the simplest numerical algorithm to solve gravitational field equations. 
This leads to the emergence of significant numerical errors, but it is not computationally complex. 
The use of the OpenCV library allowed for the creation of a simple real-time graphical visualization. 
Using a not very powerful my laptop processor, I am able to achieve smooth operation with up to 300k stars.<br /><br />
